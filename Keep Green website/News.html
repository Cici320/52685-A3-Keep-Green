    <p>In the past, people's main concern about the environment was the impact of environmental pollution on human health. The global environmental problems have far exceeded this category and involve all aspects of human living environment and space, such as sharp decline in forests, grassland degradation, desert expansion, frequent occurrence of sandstorms, air pollution, species decline, water crisis, urbanization issues etc., has penetrated into all aspects of human production and life. Therefore, in order to solve contemporary global environmental problems, we cannot simply consider our own problems, but we must take a region, a watershed, a country, and even the world as a whole, and comprehensively consider the laws of natural development, the solution of poverty, sustainable economic development, and resources. This is a complex systematic project, and various factors need to be considered in order to solve it properly. As shown in the picture, most of the earth is facing environmental pollution, so we must act quickly!</p >
